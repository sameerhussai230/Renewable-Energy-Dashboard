## 📖 Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Excel Dashboard** designed to analyze global trends in electricity generation. It focuses on the transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources, providing a deep dive into Solar, Hydro, and Nuclear energy production across different nations and timelines.

The dashboard allows users to interactively filter data to visualize how countries compare in their energy strategies and how production has evolved year over year.

## 📊 Key Features

*   **⚡ Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Analysis:**
    *   Visualize the percentage share of renewable energy against non-renewable sources for specific countries.
    *   Compare the energy mix to understand the "green" transition status of different nations.

*   **🏆 Top 10 Producers Leaderboard:**
    *   Rankings of the top 10 countries based on their total generation (TWh) of **Solar**, **Hydro**, and **Nuclear** electricity.
    *   Dynamic charts that update based on the selected year.

*   **📈 Historical Trends & Y.O.Y Change:**
    *   Line and combination charts displaying the trend of electricity generation over the years.
    *   **Year-Over-Year (Y.O.Y) Change** analysis to track growth rates, spikes, or drops in energy production.

*   **🎛️ Interactive Navigation:**
    *   Custom navigation buttons (macros/links) to switch between different energy views (Country View, Solar, Hydro, Nuclear).
    *   Slicers to filter specific Years and Countries dynamically.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

*   **Microsoft Excel:**
*   **Data Cleaning & Processing:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to structure raw data.
*   **Pivot Tables:** Used to aggregate data for dynamic reporting.
*   **Data Visualization:** Custom Formatting, Area Charts, Line Charts, and Bar Graphs.
